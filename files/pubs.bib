                                        ABSTRACT={Chimera and Solitary states have captivated scientists and engineers due to their peculiar dynamical states corresponding to co-existence of coherent and incoherent dynamical evolution in coupled units in various natural and artificial systems. It has been further demonstrated that such states can be engineered in systems of coupled oscillators by suitable implementation of communication delays. Here, using supervised machine learning, we predict (a) the precise value of delay which is sufficient for engineering chimera and solitary states for a given set of system's parameters, as well as (b) the intensity of incoherence for such engineered states. Ergo, using few initial data points we generate a machine learning model which can then create a more refined phase plot as well as by including new parameter values. We demonstrate our results for two different examples consisting of single layer and multi layer networks. First, the chimera states (solitary states) are engineered by establishing delays in the neighboring links of a node (the interlayer links) in a 2-D lattice (multiplex network) of oscillators. Then, different machine learning classifiers, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) and multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN) are employed by feeding the data obtained from the network models. Once a machine learning model is trained using the limited amount of data, it predicts the precise value of critical delay as well as the intensity of incoherence for a given unknown systems parameters values. Testing accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity analysis reveal that MLP-NN classifier is better suited than Knn or SVM classifier for the predictions of parameters values for engineered chimera and solitary states. The technique provides an easy methodology to predict critical delay values as well as intensity of incoherence for that delay value for designing an experimental setup to create solitary and chimera states.}
